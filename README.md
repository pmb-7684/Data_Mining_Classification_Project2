# Data_Mining_Classification_Project2
classification models for credit

The dataset, Default of Credit Card Clients is available from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. It is based on research paper written by Che-hui Lien Yeh in 2009 which examined default patterns of Taiwanese customers. The research compared the predictive accuracy of six data mining techniques. For their initial research, neutral network more accurately estimated the real probability of default.

For this classification project, I will be using classification models to predict if an individual will default on their next month's payment or not.

The dataset is only available in Excel (.xls) format and contains characteristics which could help us to determine if a person is creditworthy or not. It contains 30,000 observations and 23 feature
